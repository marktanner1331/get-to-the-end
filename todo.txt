homepage
    single player button

current game
    save
    check if game complete

board component
    when resizing
    now we are inside a gamecomponent
    we need to subtract the global rect of the board component

control panel:
   our active cards (including trap cards)
   opponents active cards (not including traps)
   number of cards left in deck

current game service
    ability to animate piece movements
    so we need a turn phase for Moving
    and maybe update the command types to include "turn phase changed"

    no need to support complicated observable processCommand functions
    as the board will push out a "finishedMoving()" to the current game service
    
    but i think we can do better than the processCommand function tree
    and instead have it as a subject that different components/services can subscribe to

    however a lot of the processCommand's rely on the game model being up to date first
    so maybe we update the game manually, by calling its processCommand
    and then broadcast it so everything else can update itself as expected
